# CollabMarket - APEC App Challenge 2023

## Problem Statement

MSMEs in the APEC region struggle to expand their reach into the international marketplace due to the lack of access to up-to-date information, resource constraints and communication barriers. Therefore, we have developed CollabMarket, a comprehensive marketplace and collaboration platform to facilitate seamless communication, resource and knowledge sharing and collaboration among MSMEs in the APEC region. By breaking down international barriers and providing MSMEs access to  vital resources, we empower them to unlock their full economic potential in the global marketplace. 

## Features

1. Marketplace: Businesses posts a request and MSMEs bid to fulfill the request 
2. Collaboration platform: MSME looking to collaborate with another enterprise proposes to collaborate via a call for collaboration
